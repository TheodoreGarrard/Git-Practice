Hello World!
Just doing some practice creating a local repo and pushing it to Github to 
make sure I've got this down.

Update 1:
html examples <a> </a> Opening and closing anchor.
h1 - headline one, only use one of these per website.

example of https code:
<div id = 'background'> creates a id type "background" that can be changed
and edited in css for coloring and styling etc.

<h1> Anything goes, when anyone goes anywhere. </h1> creates a headline, 
the largest font when only using base html (styling in css can adjust this 
however)

<div class = "p12"> creates a class that can hold multiple things such as 
paragraphs (<p> which can change multiple paragraphs at once in css.)
<p> When I go anywhere, and you go nowhere, we all get somewhere as fast as
I can run backward in a canoe.</p> 

This code, if you remove my notes of course, can be ran and will display very
basic things on the webpage (specifically, just text.)
